# OTTR Template for Websites

This is a template for creating websites from Rmd files hosted on GitHub with 3 automations. 

Websites will be checked for:

- check for spelling errors more intensively than RStudio and allow you to add words to the dictionary
- check for broken links


Website files will also be rendered remotely when there is a change to files that might influence the content on your website.
