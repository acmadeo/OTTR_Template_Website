## Spelling and Style Action

You may find that you have spelling errors if you get the following message from your pull request (PR):

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "spelling issue PR image", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/spelling.png")
```

If this happens, click the "Download the errors here." link. 

Then add words that are not actually misspelled but that the workflow recognizes as misspelled to the `dictionary.txt` file located in the `resources` directory.

For words that are indeed misspelled, fix the errors and push your changes to your PR. 

You should then see that your PR has a different message that tells you that you have no spelling errors.
